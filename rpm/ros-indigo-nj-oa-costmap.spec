Its role is to drive the robot forward while avoiding obstacles. It uses a local
map which position is relative to the robot but which orientation is constant.

# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
